          <em><b>Birds</b></em> are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates
          constituting the class Aves, characterized by feathers, toothless
          beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a
          four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds
          live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird
          to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living
          species,[3] more than half of which are passerine, or "perching"
          birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species;
          the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant
          birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to
          fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some
          birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island
          species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also
          uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic
          environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further
          evolved for swimming.

          Birds are a group of feathered theropod dinosaurs, and constitute the
          only living dinosaurs. Likewise, the closest living relatives of birds
          are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans
          (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160
          million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern
          birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to Late Cretaceous, and
          diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene
          extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all
          non-avian dinosaurs.
